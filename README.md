# Bank_Data

1] Objective:

    Perform detailed analysis and classification of bank data to derive insights and predict outcomes using machine learning models.

2] Dataset:

    The project uses a dataset named bank.csv.
    Data contains information about customers and their interactions with a bank (e.g., marketing campaigns).

3] Technologies & Libraries Used:

      Data Handling: pandas, numpy
      Visualization: seaborn, matplotlib
      Machine Learning Models:
      Logistic Regression
      Decision Tree
      Random Forest
      k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
      Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
      XGBoost
      AdaBoost
      Naive Bayes (Gaussian and Multinomial)
      Model Evaluation:
      Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
      Confusion Matrix
      ROC Curve

4] Key Features of the Notebook:

      Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
      Understanding the data structure (shape, head, info).
      Visualizing trends and relationships between features using plots.
      Data Preprocessing:
      Encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder.
      Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
      Feature Selection:
      Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Random Forest Classifier.
      Model Training and Comparison:
      Training multiple machine learning models.
      Comparing models based on performance metrics.

5] Output:

    Identifies the best-performing model for bank data classification.
    Provides clear visualizations and insights into model performance.

6] Usage:

    Clone the repository and execute the Bank_Data.ipynb file to replicate the analysis and experiment with the data.
